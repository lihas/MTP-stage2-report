 5. Related work/ Technologies 
 - IVshmem
 - microkernels, user space drivers, UML, user space libraries for network stacks
 - IMR, LivePatch, paging, linux capabilities, cgroups, app armour, se linux, etc.
 - CRIU
2. Virtualization
 intel clear containers
3. Linux containers
	 -what are they - wikipedia
 	- types
    - comparison between them - find a paper
    - Efficiency
    - Limitations
	- WHY INSMOD IS a bad idea ? Problems in allowing access to kernel while insmod
 4.    UIO 
 5. virtualization extensions
 - virtualization extensions  - EPT, VTx, APICv
- 	KVM + KVM API
 6. Binary file analysis - sections, loading, linking, kernel module ELF
  linking,  loading, what happens when insmod is done- refer notes.

5. Exploring Design space
  - design alternatives + adv/disadv of each approach

6. Challenges
 -challenges - exposing kobjeccts in containers, interrupt delivery, etc.
 7. Implementation
 8. Verification / demonstration/ Experimentation
 9. future work
 10. conclusion
 
 
 - bringing containers closer to VM - approaches
 - bringing Vms closer to containers - intel clear containers, many others as well
 - security in linux
 - challenges
 - requirements/ use cases for each subsystem
 - containers vs VMs - table
